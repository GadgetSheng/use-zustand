## Quote
### Why zustand over redux?
* Simple and un-opinionated
* Makes hooks the primary means of consuming state
* Doesn't wrap your app in context providers
* Can inform components transiently (without causing render)

### Why zustand over context?
* Less boilerplate
* Renders components only on changes
* Centralized, action-based state management
